## What These Stats Mean
- Impressions: How many times the ad or campaign was shown to people.
- Clicks: How many times people actually clicked on the ad after seeing it.
- Conversions: How many people took a desired action after clicking—like signing up, buying something, or filling a form.

### The details section shows important rates calculated from those numbers:
- Conversion Rate: Percentage of people who converted out of total impressions.
- Click Through Rate (CTR): Percentage of people who clicked out of total impressions. Basically, this card gives a quick overview of how well a marketing campaign is performing—how many people saw it, engaged with it, and finally took action.

This kind of info helps companies like Strique track the success of their digital marketing campaigns and optimize them better.
